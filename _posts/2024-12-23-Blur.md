## Criteria For Airdrop

[Airdrop 1](https://mirror.xyz/blurdao.eth/2nba-2j0zHPrBX0iPSNGquZ9s_WotNH6B4e5usz85mM) was for everyone who traded in the 6 months prior to the launch of the Blur marketplace.
[Airdrop 2](https://mirror.xyz/blurdao.eth/BnVAt_z_6bEr9O4oLIFwyEjCmAGGb02jz8y3G7qJQhA) was for traders who actively listed on Blur through November.
[Airdrop 3](https://mirror.xyz/blurdao.eth/XgvGOFLwdxpdRIF2BRsQqngvcBw5WMuDOcwUK3KR1AE) is for traders who place bids on Blur and will be the largest Blur airdrop (around 1-2x the size of Airdrop 2).

In the airdrops mentioned above, eligible users were offered care packages as rewards. These care packages can be redeemed for BLUR tokens, which can be used within the Blur marketplace. It is worth noting that users who are eligible for the airdrops have a 60-day window to claim their rewards.
