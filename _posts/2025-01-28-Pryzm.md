## Earning Through StakeDrop

1. **Eligibility**:

   - Delegate tokens to a Pryzm validator.
   - Link your Pryzm address to your delegating address at [airdrop.pryzm.zone](https://airdrop.pryzm.zone).

2. **How it Works**:

   - **Commission**: Earn **10 PRYZM tokens** for every $1 in commission paid to a Pryzm validator.
   - **Weekly Earnings**: Keep tokens delegated to continue earning PRYZM weekly.
   - **Bonus Tokens**: Earn additional OpDrop tokens and Pryzm rewards.

3. **Ideal For**:

   - Delegators seeking extra rewards without engaging in DeFi or yield farming.

4. **Additional Notes**:
   - Participants in StakeDrop previously earned **AUUU tokens**, which allowed PRYZM earnings in Photons Seasons 1 & 2.
   - StakeDrop provides extra yield to delegators.

## OpDrop Criteria

1. **Discounted PRYZM**:

   - Each OpDrop token allows you to buy 1 PRYZM token for **$0.05** if the market price is **$0.10 or higher** between April 1 and June 1.
   - Fixed price of $0.05 applies regardless of market price increases.

2. **Queue Position**:

   - Determined by badges earned and PRYZM holdings.
   - Priority given to users with higher badge counts and token accumulation.

3. **Non-Transferable**:
   - OpDrop tokens cannot be transferred but can be utilized via off-chain agreements.
