## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://developerdao.notion.site/The-CODE-Governance-Token-3c1e14dbc6bd461fa07978bf37d04fd9)

• Base members: DAO members that held the Developer DAO NFT at the time the public mint sold out and snapshot was taken on Nov-14-2021 07:41:06 AM. These members are eligible to claim 400 $CODE tokens.
• A bonus of 417.21 $CODE will go to each early participant in the DAO, who voted on pre-Season 0 snapshot proposals or have POAPs from town halls that took place before Season 0.
• Early contributors: 10% of the total supply will go to active members who helped build the DAO and contributed beyond holding the NFT and joining an occasional meeting. This includes members who: moderated in the forum and chat, wrote proposals, created learning resources, mentored members, built software, found sponsors, planned events, etc.
