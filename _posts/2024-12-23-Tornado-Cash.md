## [Project Website](https://tornadocash.eth.link/)

According to wikipedia Tornado Cash is an open source, non-custodial, fully decentralized cryptocurrency tumbler that runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible networks. It offers a service that mixes potentially identifiable or "tainted" cryptocurrency funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the fund's original source.

## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://tornado-cash.medium.com/tornado-cash-governance-proposal-a55c5c7d0703)

* early adopters of the protocol will receive an airdrop of TORN.
* TORN will be airdropped to all addresses that made deposits into Tornado.Cash ETH pools before block 11400000.
* The airdropped amount depends on users’ deposit size and age — larger deposits and older deposits will receive more TORN. Multipliers for deposit size are logarithmic:

| Size        | Multiplier |
|  0.1 ETH    |    1       |
|  1 ETH      |    2       |
|  10 ETH     |    3       |
|  100 ETH    |    4       |
