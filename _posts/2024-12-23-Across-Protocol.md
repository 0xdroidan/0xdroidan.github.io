## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://across.to/airdrop), [To know more](https://web.archive.org/web/20221018192413/https://docs.across.to/v2/airdrop-and-token-faq)

### Community Member

     20,000,000 $ACX
     Community members who have meaningfully contributed to Across prior to the community snapshot (September 1, 2022). This includes a discord role-based allocation as well as a bonus allocation for many community members who went above and beyond. Received 5000 ACX.

### [Bridge Traveler Program](https://web.archive.org/web/20221012151506/https://docs.across.to/v2/bridge-traveler-program)

     10,000,000 $ACX*
     Active bridge users identified by the Bridge Traveler program who have not used Across prior to September 1, 2022. These users need to complete a bridge transfer on Across ahead of the ACX token launch to become eligible. The amount of ACX committed to this program is 10MM. Users who complete a bridge transfer will share these tokens with some allocation variability depending on past bridge activity. This Program ran from October 11th 2022 to November 8th, 2022
     Here's what else you need to know

     You must complete a bridge transfer using Across with at least 150 USDC or 0.1 ETH.
     10mm ACX will be reserved for this group as an airdrop allocation and will be split amongst the wallets that complete their first bridge transfer.
     However! There is an additional 10mm ACX available as an incentive. If you reach 50% conversion on this list, weâ€™ll double the amount being distributed to 20mm.
     Qualifying wallet addresses will have the tokens allocated depending on the wallet's transaction volume between January 1st, 2022 and September 1st, 2022 on other bridges. Not all bounties are equal. Please note that there is a maximum cap of 25K ACX per wallet.

### Early Bridge User

     15,000,000 $ACX
     Users who bridged assets before the Across Referral Program (July 18th, 2022). These tokens will be allocated to wallets pro-rata by the volume of transfer completed. A minimum transfer amount is required and a maximum airdrop size will be applied. Received atleast 438 tokens

### Liquidity Provider

     70,000,000 $ACX
     Liquidity providers who pool ETH, USDC, WBTC or DAI into the Across protocol before the token launch. The amount of rewards to LPs are pro-rated by size and a fixed amount of tokens will be emitted at each block since the inception of the protocol.
