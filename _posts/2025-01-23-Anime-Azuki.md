## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://www.anime.xyz/faq#token-allocation-determination)

### Core Criteria

#### Azuki, Elementals, and Beanz NFTs:

**Emblems Allocation:**

- **NFT Base Points:** The majority of allocations are derived directly from an NFT's "Collector Score." These scores can be viewed on [azuki.com/gallery](https://azuki.com/gallery).
- **Multi-token emblems:** Collectors meeting the criteria for a Multi-Token emblem (e.g., holding all defined NFTs for a specific emblem like "Family") receive bonus points as specified on their Collector Profile. The allocation for these points is distributed evenly among all eligible NFTs and added incrementally to its Base Points allocation.

**Gacha Grab & Time Held Allocation:**

- **Gacha Grab Bonus:** NFTs with specific gacha holdings are awarded a bonus allocation. Rarer gachas earn larger rewards. Any unspun credits in Gacha Grab were automatically spun at the end of the game to determine the final Gacha rewards for that NFT.
- **Time Held Bonus:** Collectors who held Azuki, Beanz, or Elemental NFTs before the start of Gacha Grab receive a small bonus allocation. This bonus was proportional to the time the assets were held, measured from the date of collection reveal to the start of Gacha Grab.

  _Note: Unrevealed Elemental Beans do not have token allocation. An Elemental Bean minted before TGE must be revealed to unlock its token allocation, which will be available for claim for approximately two years following TGE._

#### Azuki ERC-1155s:

- Allocations for certain ERC-1155 NFTs (e.g., **Ambush x Azuki, Bobu, Fractional Golden Skateboard**) will be assigned to the primary wallet on your Azuki Collector's Profile, not the NFTs themselves.
- If you have **Twin Tigers Jacket NFTs** _AND_ qualify for the **"Chiru" multi-token emblem**, that allocation will be divided evenly across all your Azuki, Beanz, and Elemental NFTs.
- **Gacha Grab Bonus Quests:** Allocation from Gacha Grab bonus quests is assigned to the primary wallet on your Azuki Collector's Profile.
