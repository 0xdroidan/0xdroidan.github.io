Users were given a 48-hour grace period from the launch of the rewards program to claim their rewards. After this period, every 24 hours, 20% of their $BADGER rewards were redistributed to a community pool. It was critical for users to claim their rewards as quickly as possible to avoid missing out on them. By the end of 5 days, all rewards would have been redistributed, and there would be no more rewards left for users to claim.
