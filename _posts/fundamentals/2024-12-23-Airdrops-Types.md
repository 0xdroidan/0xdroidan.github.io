Crypto airdrops come in various forms, each with different objectives and eligibility criteria. Here are the most common types of crypto airdrops:

### 1. **Standard Airdrops**

- **Definition:** Free tokens distributed to users who meet basic eligibility criteria, such as holding a specific cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH for ERC-20 tokens).
- **Purpose:** Increase awareness and decentralize token distribution.
- **Example:** Stellar (XLM) airdropped to Bitcoin holders in the past.

### 2. **Bounty Airdrops**

- **Definition:** Users receive tokens in exchange for completing tasks like social media promotions, referrals, or content creation.
- **Common Tasks:**
  - Following social media accounts
  - Sharing/retweeting posts
  - Writing blog posts
  - Referring friends
- **Example:** Early DeFi and NFT projects often use bounty airdrops to build a community.

### 3. **Holder Airdrops (Loyalty Airdrops)**

- **Definition:** Tokens are distributed to users who hold a specific cryptocurrency or token in their wallet for a certain period.
- **Eligibility:** Must have a minimum balance of the specified token at a snapshot date.
- **Example:** XRP holders received Spark (FLR) tokens.

### 4. **Exclusive Airdrops (Private Airdrops)**

- **Definition:** Aimed at early adopters, influencers, or community members who actively contributed to a project.
- **Purpose:** Reward loyal users and incentivize further engagement.
- **Example:** Governance token airdrops to early DeFi users.

### 5. **Fork Airdrops**

- **Definition:** When a blockchain splits into two (hard fork), holders of the original chain receive tokens from the new chain.
- **Example:** Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was distributed to Bitcoin (BTC) holders after the fork.

### 6. **Exchange Airdrops**

- **Definition:** Tokens distributed via centralized exchanges to their users, often in partnership with the project.
- **Eligibility:** Holding or trading specific assets on the exchange.
- **Example:** Binance and KuCoin frequently conduct airdrops for new listings.

### 7. **Retroactive Airdrops**

- **Definition:** Tokens are distributed to users based on past interactions with a protocol or blockchain, rewarding early adopters.
- **Criteria:** Interaction with smart contracts, trading history, governance participation.
- **Example:** Uniswap airdropped UNI tokens to users who had used the protocol before a set date.

### 8. **NFT Airdrops**

- **Definition:** NFTs are distributed instead of fungible tokens, often to existing NFT or crypto holders.
- **Purpose:** Boost engagement in NFT ecosystems and reward collectors.
- **Example:** BAYC holders receiving Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs.

### 9. **Raffle Airdrops (Lucky Draws)**

- **Definition:** Users register for an airdrop and winners are selected randomly.
- **Purpose:** Generate hype and encourage participation in project ecosystems.
- **Example:** Limited token supply projects often use this method.

### 10. **DeFi Airdrops**

- **Definition:** Rewarding liquidity providers, stakers, or yield farmers with governance or reward tokens.
- **Example:** Compound and Aave airdropping governance tokens to their users.
