Task Framing
Analyze cryptocurrency airdrop announcements to extract structured information about the airdrop details, timeline, token distribution, eligibility criteria, and related resources. Present this information in a standardized template format, handling missing information appropriately.
Context and Purpose
This extraction will be used to organize airdrop information for reference, comparison, and decision-making purposes. Complete accuracy is essential, with explicit handling of missing information using the specified formats. Proper markdown table formatting is critical for maintaining readability and consistency across all extractions.
Instructions (Read Before Processing Text)
Role Assignment
Act as a cryptocurrency data analyst with expertise in airdrops. Your task is to carefully read through the provided text and extract specific details about an airdrop announcement.
Step-by-Step Analysis Process

First, identify the project name, website, description, and token ticker
Determine the token name and airdrop type (token, NFT, etc.)
Look for explicit numerical values related to total distribution amounts
Identify any user count metrics (eligible users, current claimants)
Extract all relevant dates for the airdrop timeline
Determine the distribution parameters (max/min/average per user)
Summarize the eligibility criteria in clear, concise language
Note any additional important information about the project
Format everything according to the template structure below

Data Sources and References

The primary source for extraction should be the project's official blog posts, announcements, or documentation
When extracting from tweets, consider the limited information and look for linked resources
If information comes from multiple sources, prioritize official documentation over social media
For each key piece of information, note the source if it comes from different places:

For blog posts: Add as ## [Eligibility Criteria](blog_url)
For tweets: Add tweet URL to Important Links section as Eligibility Criteria: [Twitter Announcement](tweet_url)


Always verify information against the most authoritative source available

Data Handling Rules

If information is explicitly stated, extract it exactly as presented
If information is implied but not explicit, use your judgment and note uncertainty
If information is completely absent, follow the specific missing data protocols below
For numerical values, include units (tokens, ETH, etc.) when available
Ensure all markdown tables are properly formatted with correct header rows, separators, and aligned columns
Do not leave table cells empty - use "Not Known" for missing information

Missing Data Protocols

For most fields: If information not found, write "Not Known"
For "Number of Eligible Users" and "Number of Claimants": If not found, use comment format shown below
For entire "Token Distribution" section: If not found, use comment format shown below

<missing_data_format>
{% comment %}
[Field name] information not available
{% endcomment %}
</missing_data_format>
Formatting Guidelines

Use proper markdown table formatting throughout
Wrap text in table cells when content exceeds 90 characters, like this:
Copy| Project Description | A modular blockchain oracle providing secure and scalable data feeds |
|                     | for DeFi and blockchain applications.                                |

For multi-line cells, leave the first column empty except in the first line
Maintain consistent column widths throughout tables for better readability
Ensure all pipes (|) align vertically for a clean presentation
