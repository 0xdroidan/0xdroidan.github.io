Layer Architecture:

Layer 1 (Base Layer):

Solana: Airdrops specific to this high-performance blockchain ecosystem, known for fast transactions and low fees
Cosmos: Airdrops within the interconnected Cosmos ecosystem, including various zones and IBC-enabled chains
Ethereum: Airdrops from projects built on the original smart contract platform
Aptos: Airdrops from the Move-based blockchain ecosystem
Other L1s: Airdrops from other major base layer blockchains like Polkadot, Avalanche, etc.


Layer 2 (Scaling Layer):

Ethereum L2s: Airdrops from scaling solutions built on Ethereum (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync)
Other L2s: Airdrops from scaling solutions for other base layer blockchains



DeFi (Decentralized Finance):

DEX: Airdrops from decentralized trading platforms where users can swap tokens without intermediaries
Lending: Airdrops from platforms enabling crypto lending and borrowing
Liquidity: Airdrops targeting users who provide liquidity to various protocols
Perps: Airdrops from platforms offering perpetual futures trading contracts
Options Vault: Airdrops from protocols focused on options trading and structured products
Yield Aggregator: Airdrops from platforms that optimize yield farming across multiple protocols
LSDFi/LST: Airdrops from liquid staking protocols that allow users to stake assets while maintaining liquidity
RWA: Airdrops from projects that tokenize real-world assets like real estate or commodities
BTCFi: Airdrops from DeFi protocols specifically built around Bitcoin
Stablecoin: Airdrops from projects creating or managing stable-value cryptocurrencies

Infrastructure:

Bridge/Cross Chain: Airdrops from protocols enabling asset transfers between different blockchains
Oracle: Airdrops from projects providing reliable external data to smart contracts
Wallet: Airdrops targeting users of specific cryptocurrency wallets
Naming Service: Airdrops from blockchain-based domain name systems

Gaming & Social:

GameFi: Airdrops from blockchain games and gaming platforms
SocialFi: Airdrops from platforms combining social media with financial incentives
GambleFi: Airdrops from blockchain-based gambling and betting platforms

DePIN:

Airdrops from projects building decentralized physical infrastructure networks (e.g., wireless networks, computing resources)

Distribution Methods:

Quests: Airdrops requiring completion of specific tasks or missions
Points: Airdrops based on accumulated points from platform activity
Testnet: Airdrops rewarding participation in protocol testing
2nd Drop: Additional airdrops from projects that have already conducted initial distributions
Free: No-requirement airdrops distributed freely to qualifying addresses
Retroactive: Airdrops rewarding past usage or contributions to protocols

Other:

Meme Coin: Airdrops of community-driven or joke tokens
BBN: Airdrops from networks and protocols building on Bitcoin's security or functionality

Each category represents a distinct approach to token distribution and reflects different aspects of the blockchain ecosystem. Projects may fit into multiple categories, as they often combine various elements (e.g., a GameFi project might also have NFT elements and use L2 scaling).

DEX (Decentralized Exchange): Airdrops associated with decentralized trading platforms.
Liquidity: Airdrops aimed at rewarding or incentivizing liquidity providers.
Ecosystem: Airdrops distributed to users within a specific blockchain or project ecosystem.
NFT (Non-Fungible Token): Airdrops related to NFT projects, often rewarding holders or creators.
Points: Airdrops where participants earn points to claim tokens, often based on engagement or activity.
LSDFi (Liquid Staking DeFi): Airdrops from projects that involve liquid staking solutions in DeFi.
SocialFi: Airdrops from platforms combining social media with finance elements.
Testnet: Airdrops given to users for participating in or testing a project's testnet.
Free: General category for airdrops that don't fit neatly into other categories but are distributed freely.
Bridge: Airdrops for projects or protocols that help in transferring assets between different blockchains.
GameFi: Airdrops from projects that integrate gaming with financial elements.
Infra (Infrastructure): Airdrops from projects focusing on blockchain infrastructure improvements.
Quests: Airdrops where users complete tasks or quests to qualify.
Wallet: Airdrops linked to the use of specific crypto wallets.
Oracle: Airdrops from projects providing decentralized data feeds.
BBN (Bitcoin-Backed Networks): Airdrops related to projects that leverage Bitcoin in some capacity.
DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks): Airdrops from projects that aim to decentralize physical infrastructure.
Domain: Airdrops associated with blockchain-based domain services.
Gambling: Airdrops from crypto gambling or betting platforms.
Perp (Perpetual Futures): Airdrops from projects offering perpetual futures trading.
RWA (Real World Assets): Airdrops connected to projects that tokenize real-world assets.
SLR (Staking Layer Rewards): Airdrops where rewards are given for staking in layered protocols.
2nd Drop: For projects that have conducted a second airdrop event.

Layer 1 (L1):
Solana: Airdrops specific to the Solana blockchain ecosystem.
Cosmos: Airdrops within the Cosmos network, including its connected zones.
General L1: Airdrops from other major or notable Layer 1 blockchains not specifically listed (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot).
Layer 2 (L2):
Ethereum L2: Airdrops from Ethereum's scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.
General L2: Airdrops from other Layer 2 solutions across different blockchains.
