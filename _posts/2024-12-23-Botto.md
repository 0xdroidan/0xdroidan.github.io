## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://docs.botto.com/details/token-distribution/airdrop)

The Botto airdrop is divided into four tiers with varying amounts of $BOTTO tokens awarded based on the number of interactions with qualifying projects. To be eligible for any tier, at least one interaction with a qualifying project is required. An interaction is defined as either holding or minting an NFT from the qualifying project at the time of data pull using the Etherscan API. Regardless of the number of NFTs minted, or whether an NFT was held or minted, each qualifying project counts as one interaction. In addition, interactions made before June 21, 2021, are also counted as one interaction.

Tier 1 requires at least one interaction with a qualifying project.
Tier 2 requires interactions with at least two qualifying projects.
Tier 3 requires interactions with at least five qualifying projects and is open to early contributors, including testers, consultants, advisors, and supporters.
Finally, the fourth tier is exclusively for initial team members to redistribute tokens at their discretion.
