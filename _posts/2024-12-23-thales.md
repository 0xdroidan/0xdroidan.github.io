## [Project Website](https://thalesmarket.io/)

Thales is a Novel on-chain and permission-less protocol that allows the creation of peer-to-peer parimutuel markets that anyone can join. The simple but powerful smart contracts at the foundation of Thales Market enable you to participate in markets for different crypto assets. The protocol also offers community-based games like Thales Royale and more advanced trading products like Ranged Markets.
