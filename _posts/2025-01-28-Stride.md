## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://www.stride.zone/blog/stride-airdrop-details)

# Host-Chain Onboarding

Chains must be onboarded for Stride liquid staking to be included in the airdrop program.
Addresses staking the chain's governance token at the snapshot block height are eligible.

## Staking Thresholds:

- **Minimum Threshold:** $100 worth of governance tokens (at the snapshot).
- **Maximum Threshold:** $50,000 worth of governance tokens (at the snapshot).
  - Users above the max threshold are eligible, but only up to $50,000.

## Exchange Validators Excluded:

- Tokens staked with exchange validators (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) are not eligible.

## Snapshot:

- Specific block heights and snapshot dates were used to determine eligible stakers.

## Redistribution Mechanism

### Unclaimed STRD:

- Any unclaimed STRD is redistributed monthly to the original recipients.
  - This encourages active participation and ensures eventual full distribution of tokens to engaged users.

### Example:

- If a user does not claim their STRD during the initial 3-month window, their unclaimed STRD is redistributed to others proportionally based on their original allocation.

## Claiming Tasks and Vesting

### Airdrop Distribution:

- **20% Freely Claimable:** No action needed except clicking "claim."
- **20% Task:** Stake the initial 20% to claim this portion (starts vesting for 3 months).
- **60% Task:** Liquid stake any amount of ATOM with Stride to unlock the final 60% (vests for 3 months).

### Vesting Period:

- Claimed STRD vests linearly over 3 months.

## Injective-Specific Criteria

### Metamask Users:

- Must export their mnemonic from Metamask and import it into Keplr to claim STRD.
- Does not support Ledger yet.

## Exclusions:

- Tokens staked with exchange validators.
- Addresses staking governance tokens below the minimum threshold at the snapshot.
