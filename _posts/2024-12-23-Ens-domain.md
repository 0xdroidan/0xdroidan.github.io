## [ENS Website](https://ens.domains/)

According to thier website The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY)

* Ownership of at least one .ETH second-level domain name at any point in time.
* The distribution of airdrop is based on the total time of an address's past registration and future registration as of October 31st, 2021.
* The retroactive airdrop is per account, not per name.
* Each address is counted for a given day based on whether it owns at least one .ETH name on that day.
* A 2x multiplier for Ethereum accounts that have set their Primary ENS Name (formerly known as Reverse Record) since this is an indicator that someone is an active user.
* The airdrop formula: 0.27 \* (# days the account owned at least one ENS name) + 0.062 \* (# days until the expiration of the last name on the account)
* The total is then multiplied by 2 if the account also has a Primary ENS Name set.
