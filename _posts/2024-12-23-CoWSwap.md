In February, Gnosis DAO distributed untransferable vCOW tokens to early adopters on both Ethereum and Gnosis Chain. The claiming process for the airdrop came to a close on March 28 2022, as per the terms defined in the initial smart contract deployment by Gnosis DAO. Those who claimed the airdrop were required to exchange their vCOW tokens for COW, a newly introduced tradable token.

## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1487140241102319622?s=20)

GNO Holders Airdrop ü¶â
    GNO holders needed a minimum balance of at least 0.1 GNO. They were eligible for holding GNO on Mainnet and/or GnosisChain, and for running GBC validators. In addition, all the following LP token holders were accounted for:

        * Balancer V2 (Mainnet)
        * Uniswap V3 (Mainnet)
        * HoneySwap (Gnosis Chain)
        * Symmetric (Gnosis Chain)
        * SushiSwap (Gnosis Chain)
        * Elk (Gnosis Chain)
        * Swapr (Gnosis Chain)

CowSwap User Airdrop üêÆ

There are 3 categories under which a user can qualify:

- CoW POAPs
    Users who have been *awarded* a POAP are eligible for vCOW. Not all are equally valuable. Some that are most special are the ones for our CowStars and User Test Participants.

- Power Traders
    We categorized our power users based on following criteria:

        - minimum 3 trades
        - at least 14 days between 1st & last trade
        - minimum 1K volume total

    Cool thing: for this metric data of both networks was combined, 1 swap on GC + 2 on Mainnet could qualify you.

- Traders
    Eligible is everyone who either traded at least once for a total of 1K OR who has done at least 5 trades. Also for this metric an addresses' behavior across both networks was combined to make sure nobody falls through the grip.

To exclude the most obvious attempts at wash trading, we accounted stable to stable coin trades only by factor 0.1 in both the Power Trader and in the Trader categories.

We didn‚Äôt exclude them fully, but it would be unfair to count it the same.
