## Eligibility Criteria

### Osmosis Proposal Voters:

- Voting was required but not additive (users who voted on both received the highest eligible amount, not a combined total).
- Delegators to validators who voted on the proposals also received airdrops, with validators receiving allocations based on self-delegations.

### Migaloo Participants:

- Users involved in activities on the **Migaloo** blockchain, particularly on the **White Whale (WW) decentralized exchange (DEX)**.
- Required actions included:
  - **Staking** $WHALE (native token of White Whale) with validators.
  - **Providing liquidity** on the WW DEX.
  - Completing **specific staking missions** via **Station Wallet**.
- Participants had to hold tokens in their wallets at the time of the snapshot to qualify.

## Additional Information

- The airdrop was facilitated through **Coinhallâ€™s Genie protocol**.
- Users needed a compatible Cosmos-based wallet (e.g., **Station Wallet**) with **sufficient gas fees** in **$WHALE** or **$OSMO** to claim tokens.
- The campaign aimed to **reward governance participation and ecosystem engagement**, rather than passive holding.
