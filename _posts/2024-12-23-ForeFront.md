## [Criteria For Airdrop](https://forefront.gitbook.io/forefront/token-distribution/community-airdrop)

* Allocations were assigned based on the number of unique social tokens held, with a minimum number of social tokens required to access token permissioned groups. For example, 55 for FWB, 1000 for JAMM, 17 for WHALE, etc.
* Users were eligible for the FF Airdrop if they held the minimum number of social tokens required to join the token permissioned chat. If there was no minimum amount, the default number was set at 10 tokens (with the exception of $RLY).
* The airdrop snapshot was taken before the Roll social token hack, ensuring an accurate representation of the social token community before the incident.
* Holders of each social token received a base allocation of approximately 238 FF tokens.
* A total of approximately 6,742 addresses qualified for the airdrop.
* In addition to the base allocation, SWAGG holders received a 2x allocation, FWB holders received a 1.25x allocation, and WHALE holders received a 1.15x allocation.
* The base FF allocations stack, meaning holders of WHALE, FWB, and SWAGG receive three FF allocations instead of a fixed allocation of 238 FF.
