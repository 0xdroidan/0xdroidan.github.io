title: Types of Airdrops
---

There are several types of crypto airdrops:

Standard Airdrops: These are the most common types of airdrops. In this type of airdrop, a certain amount of tokens are distributed for free to users who meet specific requirements, such as following the project on social media or joining their Telegram group.

Bounty Airdrops: These airdrops are similar to standard airdrops, but users are required to complete specific tasks or participate in the project in some way, such as creating content or referring new users, to be eligible for the tokens.

Holder Airdrops: Holder airdrops are targeted towards existing token holders. These airdrops reward users who already hold a certain amount of the project's tokens.

Fork Airdrops: Fork airdrops occur when a cryptocurrency project splits into two different cryptocurrencies. Users who hold the original tokens receive an equal amount of the new tokens.

Surprise Airdrops: These airdrops are unexpected and not publicly announced. They are often used to reward active users or to surprise and delight the community.

Partner Airdrops: These airdrops occur when two or more projects partner together to distribute tokens to their respective communities. For example, a project may partner with an exchange to distribute tokens to the exchange's users.

Hard Fork Airdrops: Hard fork airdrops occur when a cryptocurrency project undergoes a hard fork, resulting in the creation of a new blockchain and a new token. Users who hold the original tokens may receive the new tokens as part of the airdrop.

Retroactive airdrops, also known as airdrop snapshots, are a type of airdrop that distributes tokens to users based on their past activities or holdings, rather than their current participation in the project.

In a retroactive airdrop, the project will take a snapshot of the blockchain at a specific point in time and distribute tokens to users who meet certain criteria based on their holdings or activity at that time. For example, a project may distribute tokens to users who held a certain amount of their tokens on a specific date, or to users who made transactions on their platform before a certain date.

Retroactive airdrops are a way for projects to reward early adopters and incentivize participation in the project, even if users have not actively participated recently. They can also help to increase the distribution of the project's token and generate buzz within the community.
It's important to note that retroactive airdrops are typically announced in advance, and users must meet the specific criteria in order to receive the tokens. 

Incentivized testnets are experimental networks that offer rewards to participants for testing a blockchain or cryptocurrency project before its official launch. The goal of an incentivized testnet is to simulate real-world conditions and test the scalability, security, and functionality of a project's network.

Participants in an incentivized testnet typically include developers, early adopters, and community members. These participants are incentivized to help test the network by offering rewards such as cryptocurrency or other tokens. The rewards are typically distributed based on the amount of work or contribution that a participant makes to the testnet, such as running a node, providing feedback on the network, or finding bugs or vulnerabilities.

Incentivized testnets are a way for projects to gather feedback, identify bugs or vulnerabilities, and fine-tune their networks before the official launch. They also help to build a strong community around the project and incentivize users to become early adopters. Participants in an incentivized testnet can also gain valuable experience in working with blockchain technology and help to shape the future of the project.

Users should always verify the legitimacy of a retroactive airdrop before participating, as there have been instances of fraudulent retroactive airdrops designed to trick users into giving away their private keys or other sensitive information.
