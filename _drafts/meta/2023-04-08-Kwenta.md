Discounted Token Sale for Early Users
Overview: Rather than a standard airdrop, Kwenta allowed early users of the platform and Synthetix stakers to purchase $KWENTA tokens at a significant discount compared to the public sale price.

Eligibility:
Users who were active on Kwenta or Synthetix before a specific snapshot date (exact date not consistently specified in recent sources but tied to early platform usage).

Specifically, early Synthetix stakers and synthetic asset traders were targeted.

Details:
Public sale price was approximately $300 per $KWENTA token.

Early users could buy at around $30 per $KWENTA token (in sUSD), a 90% discount.

This was facilitated through an Aelin pool, a mechanism for decentralized token sales.

Timeframe: One instance of this sale had a deadline in November 2022 (e.g., posts on X from November 10, 2022, indicated 4 days remained to claim), but no active sales are ongoing as of March 18, 2025.

Trading and Staking Rewards Program
Overview: Kwenta has a points and rewards system tied to trading activity and staking, which distributes $KWENTA tokens over time rather than as a one-time airdrop.

Eligibility:
Trading: Users who trade perpetual futures on Kwenta (on Optimism, Base, or Arbitrum) earn points based on trading volume and fees paid. For example, 20 points are awarded per $1 in trading fees.

Staking: Users who stake $KWENTA tokens can earn inflationary rewards and additional trading incentives.

Referrals: Creating and sharing referral codes allows users to earn a portion of rewards from referred traders.

Details:
Points can unlock exclusive rewards each season, with a confirmed token drop tied to the points program.

Staking rewards include weekly inflationary $KWENTA emissions (e.g., starting at 14,463.37 $KWENTA per week, decreasing over four years).

Staked tokens face a 1-year lock-up period, with early vesting incurring a fee (90% initially, decaying linearly to 0% after a year).

Timeframe: Ongoing as of March 18, 2025, with no fixed end date specified for the rewards program.

OP Token Incentives (Phase 0 Proposal)
Overview: Kwenta proposed using 900,000 OP tokens from Optimism to incentivize trading and development, indirectly tied to $KWENTA rewards.

Eligibility:
Traders: 1,000 traders who couldn’t claim $DYDX tokens, had a $1,000+ deposit on dYdX, and met Kwenta trading criteria (10 trades, 10% PnL, $5,000 sUSD cumulative volume).

Contributors: Governance and development contributors to the Kwenta DAO received OP tokens, with some allocation for devDAO bounties.

Details:
Successful claimants received OP tokens and trading incentives in $KWENTA (locked for 1 year but stakeable).

Claim period lasted 6 months from the program’s start (post-$KWENTA launch, around mid-2022), with unclaimed tokens reverting to the treasury.

Timeframe: Historical, likely concluded by early 2023.
