Welcome to our Archive of Cryptocurrency Airdrops - Your One-Stop Destination for Everything You Need to Know about Historical Airdrops Criteria's! Our website is designed to make it easy for you to explore the captivating world of airdrops. Discover the rules and eligibility criteria used by various projects to conduct airdrops.

# Our Purpose

The **Airdrop Criteria Archive** was created to document and analyze historical airdrop distribution criteria used by blockchain projects. Our mission is to provide an educational resource that helps the community understand how airdrops work, what criteria projects use to distribute tokens, and how to analyze past distributions to better understand future opportunities.


## Why We Built This

Cryptocurrency airdrops have become an important mechanism for token distribution, community building, and project bootstrapping. However, information about airdrops is often scattered across various sources, making it difficult to find comprehensive and accurate data about distribution criteria, eligibility requirements, and historical context.

This archive aims to solve that problem by:

- Documenting historical airdrops with structured data about their distribution criteria  
- Providing educational resources to help users understand airdrop mechanics  
- Analyzing patterns and trends in token distribution strategies  
- Creating a searchable database of airdrop information for research purposes  


## Our Methodology

Each airdrop listing in our archive is researched using multiple sources, including:

- Official project documentation and announcements  
- Community discussions and reports  
- On-chain data analysis  
- Post-distribution analysis and retrospectives  

We strive to provide accurate and comprehensive information, but cryptocurrency moves quickly, and some details may be incomplete or subject to change. If you notice any inaccuracies or have additional information to contribute, please consider submitting corrections or additions through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/).
